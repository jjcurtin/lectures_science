Dave gave me 5-7 minutes to cover a lot of ground so my plan is to 

- First bullet point the rationale for our focus on digital therapeutics for relapse prevention
- Then to describe enough of what we have done to date to give you a sense how we are approaching the problem and what we believe is possible now or very soon
- And I'll end by highlighting important next steps that are mostly shovel ready pending support given the preliminary work we've done

Of course, I am happy to unpack any of what I present in more detail when we move to questions.  So lets jump right in....

-----

We all know that we have a serious problem with treatment access and utilization for individuals with SUD

- Fewer than 1/10 people with an active SUD receive any treatment in any given year
- Large health disparties make these numbers even worse for vulnerable gropus defined by race, ethnicity and geography 
- These numbers are worth still for continuing care following initial treatment even though we know that SUDs often require lifelong management

-----

Our failure to provide treatment and continuing care is not surprising given many well-known barriers to clinician delivered care 

We believe that digital therapeutics can play an important role in addressing these barriers to treatment and contiuing care for relapse prevention because they are 

- Accessible everywhere
- Available everyday, 24/7
- and highlighly scalable, which may lower costs

-----

Dave and his center have been leaders in this field for decades, 

- Developing conintuing care technologies first for computers, 
- Then for the web, 
- And progressing in 2014 to an RCT of the smartphone version of his digital therapeutic for SUD called A-CHESS. And this RCT has been followed by many other trials and field studies

-----

Of course, reducing barriers to continuing care with digital therapeutics would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were not effective....But they are.

- Patients with SUDs who use a digital therapeutic have almost double the odds of being abstinent from alcohol or other drugs
- And these benefits are durable - they have been documented up to 12 months after the start of treatment.  

-----

BUT, at this point, its important to acknowledge that the digital therapeutics available today are still best considered beta versions relative to their full potential in my opinion

Their power comes from easy, 24/7 access to their many supports - the treatments, tools, and services built into these apps. But this is also their Achilles heel. As the patient using these apps, you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

- When should I use them?
- For how long?
- Which of their many supports are best for me?
- And which are best for me **right now**, at this moment in time?

-----

These are essentially precision mental health questions about providing the right supports to the right people at the right time, every time

And we believe digital therpeutics are optimially suited to provide such personalized care if we enhance them with embedded sensing capabilities and machine learning risk prediction models 

We've already made important strides in sensing and risk prediction from a recently completed NIAAA protocol that focused on AUD and an ongoing NIDA protocol focused on OUD that will finish data collection at the end of the year and these projects can give you a good sense of our plans to improve digital therapeutics 

-----

So how are we approaching this precision mental health challenge to increase the effectiveness of SUD digital therapeutics?

We have begun to develop risk models that focus both on **predicting** and **explaining** future lapses in the AUD sample

We focus on predicting future lapses because lapses are 

- Clearly defined
- They have a temporally precise onset
- They precede but often predict relapse and therefore can serve as an early warning sign for relapse
- Clinically, maladaptive responses (or AVEs) in response to lapses can increase relapse risk
- And looking ahead to opioids and other substances, even single lapses can result in overdoses and deaths

-----

The inputs to these lapse prediction models come from feature engineering  three separate but complementary sets of raw signals that can be sensed within A-CHESS.  These are

- Ecological momentary assessments to track users subjective experiences over time
- Geolocation
- Cellular communications including meta data from calls and texts and text message content

-----

Each of these signals are easy to collect with standard technologies available on smartphones so we dont have to worry about churn with respect to bleeding edge sensors

Participants in both projects have found all three sensing methods to be acceptable.  
 - We get high rates of compliance with EMA when used for up to 1 year
 - Among almost 600 participants across these two projects all but several have been willing to share their geolocation and cellular commuications data with us

And we believe we can feature engineer strong and interpretable predictors for future lapses from each of these sources 

-----

And that is what we are doing now.  With the AUD sample, we have begun to develop future lapse prediction models with high temporal resolution 

- In other words, we arent looking to simply identify individuals at high risk for lapses 
- Instead we want to know precisely when these lapses will occur  

-----

And we have already demonstrated that we can do this with features from EMA

- We have developed models to predict future lapses in the next week, the next day, and even the next hour
- These are true prediction models in the full sense of the word "predict"
  - In other words, the features were all measured before the windows in which we observed the lapses so that we are predicting into the future
  - And we evaluated these models on held-out new observations from new participants that were never seen during training


And these models perform exceptionally well, with all three auROCs at or above .90, even when predicting lapses in precise one-hour windows

-----

This gives us the first two pieces we need for a precision mental health solution in A-CHESS - it tells us who needs support and when that support is needed.   

But we can also apply emerging methods from the field of interpretable AI to these lapse prediction models to begin to understand why they are at risk for lapses and therefore what supports they may need to prevent that lapse

-----

In the bottom right figure, I am showing you SHAP values 

Train models using location and communication signals

- Lower burden
- Could improve performance furhter
- New features for distinct risks not measured by EMA

-----

Optimize algorithmic feedback so that people trust and follow recommendations

- probability
- trends
- features
- recommendations

-----

Evaluate the clinical benefits of Smart DTx with embedded sensing and algorithms


Issues of algorithmic fairness

- More diverse training data (race/ethnicity but also geography)
- Identification of biased features



-----

Further development of DTx interventions and supports

- The commercial version of A-CHESS has recently expanded to include CBT4CBT modules based on Kathleen Carrols work
- My collegagues and I are well-positioned as clinical psychologists with expetise in SUD treatment to do further module and support development
- There are attractive synergies at UW between Dave's center and Richie Davidisons Center for Healthy Minds, which will allow us to capitalize on intervention development in the mindfulness space including MBSR and Mindfulness based relapse prevension
- Quality intervention and support development is critial as we puruse our precision mental health goals because if we are going to personalize support we need to have robust content in place to recommend to patients depending on their specific risk factors and needs at any moment in time.
