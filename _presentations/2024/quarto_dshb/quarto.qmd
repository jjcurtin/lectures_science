# Overview

Today is an informal guided tour of the tools and systems used for scientific publishing broadly

- Quarto Publishing System
- R Markdown
- R and the Tidyverse
- Git and Github

- Provide some instruction but good docs are available at
  - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) 
  - [Github Support](https://support.github.com/)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs)
  - [Tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)


# Quarto Publishing System

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system

- Can publish numerous products
  - Reports in html, pdf, or other formats
  - Manuscripts as html, pdf, or word
  - Slide decks - locally or on web
  - Books on web
  - Websites

- Can reuse the same code for these products
- Products update as data or analysis decisions are updated
- Provides for transparency (code and output can be combined)  
- Text based system works will with version control

# The Evolution of the Quarto Document

1. The R script


# Git

What is git and why do we use it?

- distributed version control system
- no need for _1, _2 _2024-01-1
- safe (for students use; for disasters)
- easy to track changes
- easy to share with others
- meant primarily for text (not binary; not data) 


# Github

- Host remote (vs. local) repo
- Pull down from remote when starting work
- Push up to remote when done working
- Free (for most features)
- Most well known hosting service (gitlab, sourceforge)
- Used to distribute code for apps, materials from books/course, code from studies

- Can also be used to easily "publish" and maintain products (studies, books, websites) when combined with a publishing system like Quarto

-----

610 course materials are available in my github repo: 

- [https://github.com/jjcurtin/book_glm](https://github.com/jjcurtin/book_glm)


URL is standardized:  github.com/username/repo_name

I have public repos for

- courses I teach
- every study we publish (code and now papers, analysis notebooks, not data)
- generic code we share: [https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support](https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support)
- slide decks

-----

Github repos can be configured to display a webpage

  - This webpage can be authored and published using Quarto (and R)
  - Can use these web pages for course materials and open source books
  - Study manuscript and notebooks
  - your personal website/portfolio of products
  
These website are accessed at:

  - username/github.io/repo_name
