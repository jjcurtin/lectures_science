- Bullet point the rationale for our focus on digital therapeutics 
- Describe enough of what we have done date to give you a sense how we are approaching the problem and what may be possible
- Highlight important next steps that are mostly shovel ready pending support given the preliminary work we've done

-----

- We all know that we have a serious problem with treatment access and utilization for individuals with SUD.

- Few than 1/10 r.eceive SUD treatment in any given year
ple 
- Depending on the year and how you quanity it, only approximately 1 in 10 people with an active SUD receive any treatment for that SUD. 

- And this failure to treat is even more troubling for vulnerable groups.  Black and LatinX adults receive mental healthcare services at only half the rate of whites.  And similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural communities and for those with lower incomes.

- And these are just the numbers for initial treatment with medications and behavioral interventions.   Despite recognizing that SUDs are chronic and may require lifelong management, access and use of ongoing continuing care is even worse still.

Unfortunately, our failure to treat is not surprising.  There are many well known barriers to receiving traditional mental healthcare.

- These include problems with access that affect everyone but are particularly limiting for people living in rural communities

- There are problems with availability

- Treatment costs are often prohibitive for those without health insurance 

- and stigma and related issues make traditional treatments for mental illness less acceptable to some patients.

We believe that digital therapeutics can play an important role in addressing barriers to treatment and contiuing care for relapse prevention because they are 

- Accessible everywhere

- Available everyday, 24/7

- and highlighly scalable, which may lower costs

[PAUSE]

Of course, these benefits would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were not effective.

- But they are.

- For example, patients with substance use disorders who use a digital therapeutic have almost double the odds of being abstinent from alcohol or other drugs

- These increases in abstinence from using digital therapeutics are observed not only when compared to patients on wait lists, who have yet to gain access to treatment but also when digital therapeutics are added on top of traditional treatments for substance use disorders.

- And these benefits are durable - they have been documented up to 12 months after the start of treatment.

As we all know, these apps are in use today with patients with SUD, but they are still best considered beta versions relative to their full potential. 

Their power comes from easy, 24/7 access to their many supports - the treatments, tools, and services built into these smartphone apps. But this is also their Achilles heel. As the patient using these apps, you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

- When should I use them?

- For how long?

- Which of their many supports are best for me?

- And which are best for me **right now**, at this moment in time?

-----

The next wave of digital therapeutics, lets call them smart digital therapeutics, must learn to know us well enough to recognize when we are at greatest risk for relapse and they must be smart enough to recommend the specific supports that would be most effective for us at that moment in time to prevent that relapse.

And these apps will do this through the use of built-in machine learning algorithms that are powered by personal sensing.

We've already made important strides in this direction from two parallel sensing and algothims focused grants

- An NIAAA protocol where we followed 151 individuals from the broader madison area in early recovery from AUD for 3 months.  We've completed data collection and are building algorithms with these data now

- And a NIDA protocol where we have enrolled slightly over 400 participants with OUD from across the US and followed them for one year

-----

At this point, we are focusing on sensing with three separate but complementary sets of raw signals within A-CHESS.  These are

- Ecological momentary assessments to track users subjective experiences over time
- Geolocation
- Cellular communications including meta data and text message content


Participants in both projects have found all three sensing methods to be acceptable.  
 - We get high rates of compliance with EMA when used for up to 1 year
 - All of our participants with AUD opted in, with very modest financial incentive, to share location and communications data with us
 - With more than 400 participants with OUD enrolled in our NIDA protocol we have had approximately 5 decline to provide either location or communications data

-----

We have begun to build risk prediction models using the AUD sample because lapses are

- Clearly defined
- Temporally precise onset
- Precede but predict relapse and can serve as an early warning sign for relapse
- Maladaptive responses (or AVEs) in response to lapses can increase relapse risk
- Looking ahead to opioids and other substances, even single lapses can result in overdoses and deaths

-----

We are looking to develop high temporal resolution prediction models

- In other words, we arent looking to simply identify individuals at high risk for lapses 
- Instead we want to know when these lapses will occur.  
- To this end, we are devloping models to predict the probability of a lapse within the next week, the next day and the even the next hour

-----

Train models using location and communication signals

- Lower burden
- Could improve performance furhter
- New features for distinct risks not measured by EMA

-----

Optimize algorithmic feedback so that people trust and follow recommendations

- probability
- trends
- features
- recommendations

-----

Evaluate the clinical benefits of Smart DTx with embedded sensing and algorithms



Issues of algorithmic fairness

- More diverse training data (race/ethnicity but also geography)
- Identification of biased features
