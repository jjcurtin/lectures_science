We all know that we have a serious problem with access to treatment and continuing care for individuals with SUD

We believe that digital therapeutics or DTx can play an important role in addressing barriers to care and today's digital therapeutics are already providing meaningful clinical benefits to research participants and patients

BUT, its also important to acknowledge that the digital therapeutics available today are still best considered beta versions relative to their full potential 

Their power comes from easy, 24/7 access to their many supports.  But this is also their Achilles heel. As the patient using these apps, you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

- When should I use them?
- For how long?
- Which of their many supports are best for me?
- And which are best for me **right now**, at this moment in time?

-----

These are essentially precision mental health questions about providing the right supports to the right people at the right time, every time

And we believe digital therpeutics are ideally situated to provide such personalized care if we enhance them with embedded sensing capabilities and machine learning risk prediction models 

-----

So how are we approaching this precision mental health challenge?

[PAUSE]

To start, we have begun to develop risk prediction models that focus both on **predicting** and **explaining** future lapses

Our focus is on predicting future lapses because lapses are 

- Clearly defined
- They have a temporally precise onset
- They can serve as an early warning sign for relapse
- And looking ahead to opioids and other substances, even single lapses can result in overdoses and deaths

-----

The inputs to these lapse prediction models come from feature engineering three separate but complementary sets of raw signals that can be sensed easily These are

- Ecological momentary assessments
- Geolocation
- Cellular communications data text message content

-----

Our goal is to use features from these signals to develop lapse prediction models with exceptionally high temporal resolution 

- In other words, we arent looking to simply identify individuals at high risk for lapses 
- Instead we want to know precisely when these lapses will occur  

-----

And we have already demonstrated that we can do this for AUD lapses with features from EMA

- We have developed models to predict future lapses in the next week, the next day, and even the next hour

- And these models perform exceptionally well.  In the top right figure, you can see that all three auROCs are at or above .90, even when predicting lapses in precise one-hour windows

-----

This gives us the first two pieces we need for a precision mental health solution in A-CHESS - it tells us **who** needs support and **when** that support is needed.   

But we can also apply emerging methods from the field of interpretable AI to these lapse prediction models to begin to understand why they are at risk for lapses and therefore recommend what supports they may need to prevent that lapse

As an example, in the bottom right figure, I am showing you local SHAP values from the next hour model.  These SHAP values allow us to know which features contibuted most strongly to each individual lapse risk prediction, in other words for a specific individual at a specific time.  

In other words, .  When someone  for specific person at a specific time. You can see that there is good variation for all the feature categories which mea

But we have only begun to scratch the surface on positioning digital therapeutics for personalized care

-----

We next need to train models using sensed location and celluar communication signals

- Lower burden
- Could improve performance further
- New features for distinct risks not measured by EMA

-----

If we are going to provide feedback to DTx users about when and how to use their DTx, we need to optimize this feedback so that people trust and follow these AI generated recommendations

- probability
- trends
- features
- recommendations

-----

Following this, we need to evaluate the clinical benefits of this optimized smart DTx

-----

Issues of algorithmic fairness

- More diverse training data (race/ethnicity but also geography)
- Identification of biased features



-----

Further development of DTx interventions and supports

- Quality intervention and support development is critial as we puruse our precision mental health goals because if we are going to personalize support we need to have robust content in place to recommend to patients depending on their specific risk factors and needs at any moment in time.

- The commercial version of A-CHESS has recently expanded to include CBT4CBT modules based on Kathleen Carrols work

- My collegagues and I are well-positioned as clinical psychologists with expetise in SUD treatment to do further module and support development

- There are attractive synergies at UW between Dave's center and Richie Davidison's Center for Healthy Minds, which will allow us to capitalize on intervention development in the mindfulness space including MBSR and Mindfulness based relapse prevension

-----

In addition to the development of more traditional digital interventions and supports, we see big opportunities for the use of large language models within DTx in at least two ways

- In the near term, if we want people to trust the support recommendations and other feedback from our risk models, there is evidence that AIs are more trusted when they are more anthrpomorthic and using LLMs for the support recommendations may help with this.

- There are also opportunites to use LLMs to practice skills that might be trained by various support modules in the digital therapuetc.  For example, users could interactively practice drink refusal skills, or practice interactions in stressful interpersonal situations.  Again, LLMs may be well-positioned to make these practices richer or more naturalistic.
